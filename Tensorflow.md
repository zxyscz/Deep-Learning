TensorFlow is used in almost every google application for machine learning. You are using TensorFlow indirectly while using applications like Google Voice Search or Google Photos. 
TensorFlow works like a computational library for writing new algorithms, that involves a large number of Tensor operations. It is widely used for deep learning applications as well since neuron numbers can be easily expressed as computational graphs. 
So, they can be implemented using TensorFlow as a series of operations on Tensors. 
Solve the key features of TensorFlow are as following. 
TensorFlow efficiently works with mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. 
TensorFlow completely supports the deep neural networks and machine learning concepts. 
TensorFlow supports GPU CPU computing where the same code can be executed on both architectures. 
Parallelism is one of the top advantages of TensorFlow, meaning that you can execute your computation on graph parallely. 
You are going to have a control over the execution, and you can schedule different tasks on different processors like GPU CPU and etc. 
But, what is the Tensor. Tensor is the core concept for TensorFlow. 
TensorFlow uses a Tensor data structure to represent all data. 
Only Tensors are passed between the operations in TensorFlow. 
You can think of a TensorFlow Tensor as an n dimensional array or at least. 
A Tensor has a rank a shape and a static type. 
So, a Tensor can be represented as a multi-dimensional array of numbers.
